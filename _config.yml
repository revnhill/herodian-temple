title: The Jerusalem Temple in the Time of Jesus
description: Beginning in 29 B.C.E., Herod the Great rebuilt the Jerusalem Temple and expanded the surrounding Temple Mount. Unfortunately, the Temple was destroyed in 70 C.E., making it hard for contemporary Christians and Jews to imagine important religious events from the first century. This site provides a 3D model of the Temple complex as a way to better understand these religious traditions.
