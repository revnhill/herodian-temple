Moving further inward on the Temple Mount were a series of concentric courts, of progressive sanctity. The area on the Mount outside of the Temple Courts was the Court of the Gentiles, because anyone was permitted to visit that space. It was not considered sacred. The second court was square and surrounded by a latticed fence with signs that warned Gentiles not to proceed further on penalty of death.

Inside this area was the Temple proper, surrounded by high walls. The Temple faced east, and the eastern half of the enclosure was the Court of the Women. All Jewish people who were considered pure according to the Law of Moses could enter this area. However, only men could proceed further. Moving west, a set of semi-circular stairs led to the Nicanor Gate, the largest of the gates entering the Temple, which was plated with brass. Inside this gate was a wide and narrow area called the Court of the Israelites, where Jewish men brought animals for required sacrifices. 

A few more steps led into the Court of the Priests, where only priests on duty could enter. It contained a large altar built with unhewn stones, a large basin fed by a subterranean cistern, and other areas and objects related to the Temple sacrifices. Gatehouses and storerooms stood along the north and south walls of the Court. One, the Chamber of Hewn Stone, stood partially inside and partially outside the Court of the Priests. The Sanhedrin, the Jewish high court met here (the room extended beyond the Temple wall so that judges could sit – no one was allowed to sit inside the Temple itself).

The Temple building was just beyond the altar and basin. It was 100 cubits tall and wide in the front, but only 40 cubits wide in the back. Its façade and doors were plated with gold. Twelve steps led from the Court of the Priests to the Porch of the Temple. The door into the Sanctuary had a lintel of five cedar beams. The Sanctuary was 40x20 cubits in size, and contained a lampstand, a table holding 12 loaves of bread, and an altar for incense. Beyond the sanctuary, separated by a thick veil or curtain, was the Holy of Holies, the most sacred area where God was said to dwell. This area was 20 cubits square and plated in gold. In it, the rock of the mountain – called the Foundation Rock – projected three fingerbreadths above floor level. The Ark of the Covenant would have stood on this rock in Solomon’s Temple. The Holy of Holies could only be entered by the High Priest, and only on Yom Kippur. 

Above the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies was an upper chamber of the same dimensions, with trapdoors allowing for repairs and upkeep of the sacred areas. On the sides and back of the building, a ring of chambers surrounded the holy areas. There were three stories of rooms and all were interconnected. They were used by the priests for storage and necessities.
