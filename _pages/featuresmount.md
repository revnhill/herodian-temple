## Features of the Heriodian Temple Mount Complex

Herod expanded the Temple Mount in three directions: north, south, and west. The Kidron Valley prevented eastward expansion. The retaining walls for the Temple mount were made up of huge rectangular stones, most weighed between 2-5 tons and were 1 m. high, placed in rows. The biggest stone found to date weighs about 400 tons. This stone is 12 m long, 2 m high, and 4 m thick. 

The level surface on the top of the Temple Mount was covered roughly 144,000 square meters. There were a number of gates through which people could enter the Temple Mount. However, the primary entrance for pilgrims was the Hulda Gates on the south side of the Temple Mount. Broad staircases led up to doors (a double door on one side and a triple door on the other. Through these doors, visitors traveled along sloped underground passageways to reach the surface. 

The surface of the Tempel Mount was surrounded by large porticoes. The largest of these was along the south wall of the Temple Mount and is known as the Royal Stoa. It contained four colonnades (one set of columns was attached to the wall), making three aisles. The central aisle was twice as high and 1.5 times as wide as the outer aisles. The Royal Stoa was where visitors could exchange secular money for temple coins (since the Ten Commandments forbade graven images and many secular coins contained images of rulers), and buy supplies for sacrifices. There was also an area at the far end for the Sanhedrin to meet.

At the northwestern corner of the Temple Mount, Herod built the Antonia fortress. Five hundred soldiers were stationed there to protect the Temple and its surroundings. From its towers, one could view everything happening inside the Temple Mount.

Beyond the northeast corner of the Temple Mount was a reservoir called the Pool of Israel.
