While the Temple Mount still exists, the Temple was completely destroyed in 70 C.E. Other sacred monuments have been built where the Temple once stood, making it impossible to conduct significant archaeological excavations on the Mount itself. How is it even possible to reconstruct such a building?

I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Computer, belay that order. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet.                </div>
